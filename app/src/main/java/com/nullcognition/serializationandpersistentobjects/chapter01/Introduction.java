   // Persistence > Data structures > UML
   // |-> Allocation > Data structures

   // aim - use persistent objects instead of a database, remove pointers/references from client code, manage data structures like databases,
   // incrlude structural patterns in data strucutre libraries, understand UML of such designs

	  root.next = (new A()).next = (new A()).next = (new A()).next = null;

	  // moving element without disconnecting will casue infinite traversal loops
	  root.next = root.next.next.next;

	  // using ring instead of null ending chains

	  A tail = root;

// using collections as first class entities support only uni-directional collections, vectors, trees, lists, but still reveals pointers
// and cannot support data structures such as Aggregate, ManyToMany, Graph, FiniteStateMachine, which require adding members (usually pointers)
// to more than one class

// javas persistance is easy because the compiler knows everything about the classes, objects, embedded references(pointers)
// When you invoke serialization on an object, it saves not only the object itself but, recursively, also all the objects it
// can reach via references.

// java serialization handles loops, but may stackoverflow if dealing with long chain of references, two classes have containel holding objects
// of the other class,

// (1) Implementation which causes a stack overflow
/*
class Book implements Serializable {
   NotJavaContainer<Author> authors;
}

   NotJavaContainer<Book> books;
}
// (2) Java container which causes a stack overflow //
class Book implements Serializable {

   ArrayList<Author> authors;
}

class Author implements Serializable {

   ArrayList<Book> books;
}
// (3) Desperate manâ€™s ManyToMany does not crash,
//
but is
neither clean
nor efficient

// Useful Trick No.1. When replacing references by hash tables, we can build bi-directional associations without inserting references
// into the participating objects. That can be useful in some situations, but it obscures the true purpose of what we are building,
// and requires more memory space and time to traverse.
